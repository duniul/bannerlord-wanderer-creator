React web app that allows creating and editing wanderers (e.g. companions) for Bannerlord. It then generates a module for the game that the user can drop into it's installation and use in the game. See the [page's FAQ](https://butterlord.com/wanderers/faq) for more information about how it works and how to use it.

Uses my simple `WandererStringsLoader.dll` module to load custom wanderer dialogue into the game. The repo for that module [can be found here](https://github.com/duniul/bannerlord-wanderer-strings-loader).
